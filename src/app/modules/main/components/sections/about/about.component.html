      <h1>hi.</h1>
      <p class="uk-dropcap bio">
        I'm Krishna Farvil, I'm a self-taught software developer based in Boston MA.
        I'm currently doing my bachelors degree at UMASS Boston.
        I'm interested in all kinds of digital technologies,
        but my major focus is on software development, I love building applications software either web, mobile or desktop from start to finish...
        <!-- I also have skills in other fields like wireframing, database and music production. I’m always looking to collaborate on
        interesting projects on site or remotely with awesome people, if you’re a small to medium sized business I’m more than sure I can help. -->
